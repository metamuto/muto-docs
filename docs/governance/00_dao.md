# Overview

MetaMuto is a network of dedicated community members who execute on decisions & protocol mechanisms voted on through community governance. 

MetaMuto is pursuing a strategy of “progressive decentralization”. Currently, major components of the platform are controlled at a high-level by the MetaMuto team. Ultimately the focus is on creating a foundation at the Treasury, Policy and economic levels, and to enable the community to directly operate protocol mechanica-in a trust-and process-minimized fashion.
