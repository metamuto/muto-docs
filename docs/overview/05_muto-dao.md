# Muto DAO

MutoDAO is a blockchain-powered system that allows autonomous communities and their verified members to interact, vote, and govern themselves through self-enforcing digital rules encoded on a public blockchain.

With decentralized voting and governance protocols fueled by an interactive token economy, MutoDAO has the collaborative potential the modern world needs with more accuracy, transparency, and flexibility.
