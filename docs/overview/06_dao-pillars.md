# DAO Pillars

# Reshaping the Modern Business Landscape:

DAOs inherit member-controlled organizations with no hierarchical management but token-based participation, transparency, cryptographic security, and decentralization. 

# Building Decentralized Collaborative Networks:

Ensuring the power of collaborative governance with established layers of control mediated by decentralized networking where more users can be added based on NFT ownership. 

# Fueling Collaboration with Token Economy:

Individual members holding Muto Tokens can create proposals and vote on them, making critical decisions collectively about the project's future.
